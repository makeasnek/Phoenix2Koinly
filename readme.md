# Phoenix2Koinly
This python script will help you convert your exported transactions from Phoenix (CSV) into the format Koinly needs. Python 3 is required to run this. It will run on Windows, Linux, and OS X. 

# How to use:
1. Open your Phoenix wallet and export your transactions in a CSV file.
2. Transfer the CSV file to your machine with python running on it. E-mail is probably the simplest way.
3. (optional, suggested) Place your CSV file into the same directory as this script and name it `phoenix.csv`. If you don't do this, the script will prompt you for absolute paths, (in Windows, right click on CSV file and select properties to find this)
4. Run the script with `python main.py` (see platform-specific instructions below)
5. output.csv will be created, which you can import into Koinly
6. Make a donation if this script has been useful (see below for more information)


<h4>Windows</h4>

 - Download the latest version of python from python.org. Enable the "install to system path" option while installing.
 - Double-click main.py or in command prompt, run `python C:\users\username\Downloads\Phoenix2Koinly\main.py` or wherever you saved the tool. I suggest the command prompt method as it will display errors if there are any.

<h4>Linux</h4>

 - Open a terminal and go to the folder you downloaded this tool into using `cd '/home/user/Downloads/Phoenix2Koinly'` or wherever you put it
 - Run `python3 main.py` in the terminal

<h4>OS X</h4>

 - Open a terminal and go to the folder you downloaded this tool into using `cd '/home/user/Downloads/Phoenix2Koinly'` or wherever you put it
 - Run `python3 main.py`
